# Octaculus

This repository contains the code implementation of Octaculus, a device which uses light dependent resistors and machine learning to create a cheap yet very effective computer-human interface. The device was created by Dan Scott. Dan, Logan Wrinkle, and I created the machine learning software together to interpret the outputs of the device, and produce a game called LDDR (Light Dependent/Dance Dance Revolution).
